## Overview

TokenCasa is a full-stack platform for tokenizing real estate that allows anyone to invest in properties starting at R$100. Built on the XRPL, the platform provides fast, low-cost transactions, automatic rent distribution, and on-chain compliance.

### Mission

Democratize access to real estate wealth by enabling micro-investors to build assets through fractional ownership, with 24/7 liquidity and automated rent distribution.

### Tagline

"Invest in real estate starting at R$100" â€” From savings to real estate wealth in 5 minutes.

### Key Differentiators

- Low minimum investment: R$100
- 24/7 liquidity through an on-chain DEX
- Automatic, on-chain rent distribution
- Built-in compliance (KYC/AML) via XRPL Credentials and MPT
- Low costs and high throughput compared to other chains

---

## Market Problem

The Brazilian real estate market has high barriers to entry: expensive purchase prices, illiquidity, and high transaction costs. Traditional real estate investment products (e.g., REITs/FIIs) also have minimums and fees that limit access for small investors.

Opportunity: tokenization unlocks a multi-trillion BRL market by enabling fractional ownership, faster trading, and transparent, auditable on-chain operations.

---

## Our Solution

TokenCasa enables fractional ownership of real estate through Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) on XRPL. Investors can buy small slices of properties, trade them on an on-chain DEX, and receive rent distributions automatically via escrow contracts.

Highlights:
- Minimum investment: R$100
- Fast execution (3â€“5s) and low fees on XRPL
- Native DEX + AMM + CAM for continuous liquidity
- Automated escrow-based rent distribution
- Integrations for IPFS (metadata), oracles (price feeds), and KYC (XRPL Credentials)

---

## How It Works

Typical investor flow (example):

1. Browse marketplace and select a tokenized property.
2. Connect wallet (Crossmark) and complete KYC.
3. Purchase tokens via the on-chain DEX or AMM.
4. Tokens appear in the investor portfolio instantly.
5. Rents collected by property owners are deposited into a time-locked escrow and distributed pro-rata to token holders.
6. Investors can sell tokens on the DEX at any time.

Example (Ana invests R$500):

- Property value: R$800,000; 1,000,000 tokens; price per token R$0.80
- Ana buys R$500 â†’ 625 tokens
- Monthly rent allocation results in small periodic payouts, distributed automatically
